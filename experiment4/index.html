				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment is trying to encapsulate a forest look in an infinitely generating world.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I colored the tiles based on the world seed accordingly, then added trees and grass to some of those tiles. 
					The user also has the ability to change the tiles to either water, a person, or a bush, according to the tile that they click on.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The most difficult part of the assignment was aligning the objects into a cohesive image. A consistent issue I had was that the objects I drew often clipped into the floor, causing only part of it to show through the tiles. I believe this was partially because of the weird angle of the camera where it made the view look 3d, even though it was actually 2d. The shadows for the circles drawn really added to the whole 3d look, which I tried to replicate in my square bushes. The easiest part was changing the tiles to match a sort of forest look, since most of what I had to do was change the shades of the floor. </p>
