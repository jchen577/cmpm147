Infinity:  
The infinite expanding world signifies the abundance of nature, were we to let it grow. The emptiness of moving life signifies the vastness of an infinite space.  
  Like how humans are unsure of life outside of Earth, the same goes for this infinite world.  
  
Variation:  
As the audience scrolls the world, they'll see trees and grass lined up to fill the void. It shows a base world that the user would not be satisfied with, thus encouraging them to change it.  

Signs of Life:  
When the user clicks on the screen, they'll have the ability to add life to the world. They can add bushes and people to fill the empty space, and they can change the surroundings with water tiles to add to the looks.
