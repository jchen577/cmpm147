				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The goal of this project was to somewhat replicate an example landscape image that I found from a google search.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>
					- Primitives: The trees are rendered with `triangle` primitives. The background is rendered with `rectangle` primitives.<br>
					- Polygons: The background mountains is made with random polygons using `vertex` calls, one colored green and one colored grey.<br>
					- Composition: Different random seed values lead to differently shaped mountains, differently positioned trees, and different sized lakes.<br></p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I think the easiest part of the assignment was trying to generate something that looked like the reference photo. The main reason for this is because
					it was fun to try and figure out how to do each individual part of the landscape. One example is the mountain and separating it into 2 layers. The
					hardest part of the assignment was getting used to using p5.js again and its syntax.
