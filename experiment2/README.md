Relation to inspring image:

- Color: The sky, grass, tree, and stone colors were sampled from the inspiring image using the Photoshop eyedropper tool.
- Primitives: The trees are rendered with `triangle` primitives. The background is rendered with `rectangle` primitives.
- Polygons: The background mountains is made with random polygons using `vertex` calls, one colored green and one colored grey.
- Composition: Different random seed values lead to differently shaped mountains, differently positioned trees, and different sized lakes.
