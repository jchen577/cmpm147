				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This experiment is attempting to use autotiling logic to generate a randomized map.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The map grid is created using an array of coordinates, generated in the function generateGrid(). The map is then drawn in drawGrid(), by looking at each coordinate of
					the grid and placing an image corresponding with the value. The grids are randomized with noise and the movement of water is also generated with noise. gridContext() is then used
					to ensure differences in the tiles.
				</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The hardest part of the assignment was definitely trying to figure out what we needed to do. We didnâ€™t get an opportunity to go over the experiment in class which got me really lost. I finally understood the core concept once I read through the reading on auto tiling provided. The easiest part of the assignment was deciding what tiles that I wanted to use for the grid. The asset sheet given was very visually appealing so I knew immediately which ones I wanted to use.
